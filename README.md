# Tamil-Catholic-Lectionary

This is a project to generate daily catholic mass readings (Lectionary) in Tamil. The project depends on [Roman-Calendar](https://github.com/jayarathina/Roman-Calendar) for calculating feasts. Currently only MySQL DB is uploaded. Soon a PHP API will be added too.

This is a work in progress.
