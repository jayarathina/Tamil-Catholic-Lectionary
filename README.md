# Tamil-Catholic-Lectionary
Generates daily catholic mass readings (Lectionary) in Tamil. This is based on my [Roman Catholic Liturgical Calendar Generator](https://github.com/jayarathina/Roman-Calendar).

## Features of this library include:
- Verse divisions are like those present in Official Tamil Lectionary. (English lectionary and Tamil Lectionary differes in verses sub divisions)
- It provides First and Second Readings, Responsorial Psalm, Alleluiya, Gosepl, Sequences (if any) for the day.
- Vigil mass readings are also displayed.
- It also provides readings proper to Saints found as in tamil lectionary - III.
- A sample full year is displayed in  [index.php](index.php)
- Readings or parts of readings will be automatically substituted. For example, on Sept 15, if it is a ferial day, Gospel alone will be taken from proper of Our Lady of Sorrows.

## Future Improvements
