# Tamil-Catholic-Lectionary
Generates daily catholic mass readings (Lectionary) in Tamil. This is based on my [Roman Catholic Liturgical Calendar Generator](https://github.com/jayarathina/Roman-Calendar).

## Examples
Live demo can be seen at
- http://lectionary.madharasan.com/
- http://arulvakku.com/calendar.php
- A sample full year is displayed in  [index.php](index.php)
- A particular day example can be found in [ViewDay.php](ViewDay.php)

## Features of this library include:
- Verse divisions are like those present in official Tamil Lectionary. (English lectionary and Tamil Lectionary differes in verses sub divisions)
- Readings or parts of readings will be automatically substituted. For example, on Sept 15, if it is a ferial day, Gospel alone will be taken from proper of Our Lady of Sorrows.
- Special care is taken to include notices (printed in red color) in the lectionary.
- It provides First & Second Readings, Responsorial Psalm, Alleluiya, Gosepl, Sequences (if any) for the day.
- Vigil mass readings are also displayed.
- It also provides readings proper to Saints found as in tamil lectionary - III.
- Exceptional cases like Palm Sunday, Eastre Vigil, Christmas are also dealth with.
- The text is presented as much as possible to look like that of a printed lectionary.

## Future Improvements
- Provide votive mass readings and others found in lectionary - IV.
